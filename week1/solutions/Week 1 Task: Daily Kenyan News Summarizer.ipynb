Meanwhile, motorists are set to face a new fee structure when using the Rironi-Mau Summit Expressway.\n",
      "2. **E-Governance**: Two headlines touch upon e-governance initiatives. The article explaining how to check Nairobi Water bill online and via SMS demonstrates efforts to make public services more accessible to citizens through digital channels. This theme suggests that the Kenyan government is placing a growing emphasis on modernizing its administrative processes.\n",
      "3. **Justice Sector Reform**: The final headline highlights an important development in the justice sector, with JSC shortlisting 100 candidates for High Court judge positions. This signifies a critical phase in Kenya's ongoing efforts to strengthen its judicial system and ensure effective justice delivery.\n",
